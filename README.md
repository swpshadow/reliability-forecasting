# reliability-forecasting


This is code associated with a publication using neural networks to predict the number of software failures at a future time using the cumulative amount of testing time. 

The code is reorganized slightly so paths should be changed. Much of the code is experimental or no longer valid approaches but is kept here for completeness. Some other files may be excluded from the public portion of the repository.
